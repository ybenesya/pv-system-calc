# Pv System Simulator
This PV Calculator gives estimations for the optimum size of a
photovoltaic system for a given area in Israel, as well as the
amount of power that can be obtained from this system.
Also, This project was chosen as a one of the [excellent Electrical Engineering projects](https://www.tauengprojects.com/finalproj/EE/2022?lightbox=comp-k231dsy8__09d15bfa-8759-40a7-815e-711533209b88_runtime_dataItem-k231dsyc) at Tel Aviv University

## Background
Recently I finished my B.Cs in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Tel Aviv University, and this project was my final project.


## Capabilities
The PV Calculator includes:
  * Estimation of the optimal tilt setting for the photovoltaic system in order to give maximum power.
  * Calculations of system size and visual presentation of the system on a map.
  * Calculations of different types of irradiance, including GHI,DNI, DHI, and incident irradiance on the PV array.
  * Estimation of max cell temperature for a given date range.
  * Estimation of the system output power, for a given date range.

This PV Calculator is designed as a user-friendly GUI.

## Technical details
* This application was Python, using external APIs for optimizing and evaluating solar panel costs and effectiveness.
